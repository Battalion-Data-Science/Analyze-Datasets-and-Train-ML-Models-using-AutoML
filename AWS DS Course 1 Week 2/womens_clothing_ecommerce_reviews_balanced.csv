-1,So much right but then....too short.,Blouses
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much  much lighter grey. in addition  this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.",Blouses
-1,I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.,Blouses
-1,This is a cute top but it runs pretty big. order a size down. the material is like a thick gauze almost  so i'd definitely wear a tank under.,Blouses
-1,The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin  kind of scratchy & has  almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as  movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!,Blouses
-1,This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale,Blouses
-1,I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy  soft cotton  but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath  which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra  but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra  which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to,Blouses
-1,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.,Blouses
-1,An absolutely gorgeous  but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.,Blouses
0,I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go,Blouses
0,"This top is super cute  however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!",Blouses
0,I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous  i could not wait. when i tried it on  it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure  just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.,Blouses
0,This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.,Blouses
0,This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.,Blouses
0,I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny  and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma,Blouses
0,Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.,Blouses
0,"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on  the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami  which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described)  but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel",Blouses
0,Nice color and great work but runs little large.,Blouses
1,For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse  a mix of various floral swatches  is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!,Blouses
1,Love this! so colorful and cute! will look great with shorts this summer  and will keep me cool in the city in the summer heat. thanks retailer!,Blouses
1,"After reading the previous reviews  i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!",Blouses
1,It's a cute top  but the only complaint i have is that it is difficult for me take off. it goes on easily  but i get always have a bit of a struggle trying to take it off. my shoulders tend to get stuck so i can't pull my arms out easily. i just wish the top had an extra button or two on the back or was made with material that allowed for some stretch without fear of destroying the lacework. i didn't want to size up another size because i have a petite body shape that would've been overwhelmed b,Blouses
1,Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide  but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!,Blouses
1,"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty  cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look  but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2""  34b  26 waist  36 hips)  so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design  in my personal opinion  i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric.",Blouses
1,A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!,Blouses
1,"Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and it hits at the top of my pants. makes me look a bit boxy. so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos. otherwise the design is gorgeous. having a hard time returning it but for the price point  it probably has to go back :(",Blouses
1,I've been looking for a great white blouse for awhile  and this is it! the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures  but i'm sure it would add some curves to any body type. the fabric is soft  not crisp  and drapes beautifully. you definitely will be doing some ironing  though. it's a bit sheer  but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami. i did buy the regular  rather than petite sizing and usually wear a 0 or 2  but had to size up to a 4 regular to avoid gaping in f,Blouses
-1,Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.,Dresses
-1,I loved everything about this dress. the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once  washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress.,Dresses
-1,The dress is very pretty  but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold  given the photo  but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.,Dresses
-1,This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.,Dresses
-1,"I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!",Dresses
-1,"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4""  120 lb  32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy.",Dresses
-1,....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad  sad  sack. the fabric is less than ideal  and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone  sadly that person was not me.,Dresses
-1,I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes,Dresses
-1,I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.,Dresses
0,Loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews. ordered size large because i weigh 155 pounds and have a large 34g bust. the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side. i probably could have sized down for a better fit  but it might have just emphasized my bust. the fabric has a substantial weight and it's lined. best as a fall  winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful. i disliked the intense black color around my f,Dresses
0,The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the,Dresses
0,"Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4"" 118lbs  athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this)  but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it  however  it is not ""flowy."" it fits okay in the shoulders  almost too loose  and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!",Dresses
0,It didn't work with my frame at all  but is very nice!,Dresses
0,Super soft  super cute but too short for a dress  too long and too overwhelming for a shirt  and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors  feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.,Dresses
0,So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.,Dresses
0,I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all,Dresses
0,I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable  but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.,Dresses
0,After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso,Dresses
1,I got this dress in the mail today  and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve  and is so flattering. for reference  i'm thin (116 lbs)  but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve  i'm usually an xsp  and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer)  or on its own.,Dresses
1,I love this dress! great fit and quality. love that the skirt is lined. this is a real throw on and go piece. i've worn it with wedges and with espadrille sneakers. my only complaint is that the sturdy material makes it difficult to get the tie waist to lay down flat. but overall an amazing dress!,Dresses
1,This dress is very comfortable  not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!,Dresses
1,Definitely shorter than expected  but a super light  airy  and comfy dress for summer nights. a must for summer dinner parties!!!,Dresses
1,Love this dress! the stripes are flattering  the material is interesting and it swings! it's feminine and fun!,Dresses
1,Love this tunic dress but i ordered a petite instead of regular because of length. fits a bit snug. i have gotten sp from retailer before and they have fit. just depends on the brand i guess. great holiday wear.,Dresses
1,"This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me  it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter.",Dresses
1,I got the white with black print and it is nice material and a pretty dress. i just would have preferred a better cut but overall pretty work dress .,Dresses
1,Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle  comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w,Dresses
-1,I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater has the weirdest stitching  although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :),Fine gauge
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge
-1,I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you,Fine gauge
-1,I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.,Fine gauge
-1,I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed  because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived  it was sold out in my size. now  i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged  i would recommend this product.,Fine gauge
-1,"Even on my 5'1""  short-waisted  100 lb body  this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.",Fine gauge
-1,"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front  but uncomfortable.",Fine gauge
-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",Fine gauge
0,I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside,Fine gauge
0,I ordered the pink  and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft  i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater  it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer  so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.,Fine gauge
0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,Fine gauge
0,Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.,Fine gauge
0,I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.,Fine gauge
0,The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,Fine gauge
0,Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff  wrinkles easily  and lays funny. returning this one.,Fine gauge
1,I love this cardigan  it is very soft  and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite  however. added this one to my wish list :-)  soft  versatile.,Fine gauge
1,Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.,Fine gauge
1,The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy (not black  as i thought it was)  but it still looks beautiful with black underneath. rather than jeans like it's shown  the v-neck is a nice change from other cardigans i have - looks great with a cami or another v-neck underneath it. soft  nice medium-weight and not at all itchy. happy with this as an easy everyday sweater.,Fine gauge
1,"Unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish  i didn't feel this way at all. i'm a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling :) here's my thoughts: ------------------------- pros: - very soft with good amount of stretch. - tulle bottom is exactly as pictured. i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe; it is not. this is pink/nude shade all the way. - runs tts. i'm a 36c  hourglass  5'9"" and found the medium to be",Fine gauge
1,Cozy  soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.,Fine gauge
1,"Love this sweater! beautiful detail  thicker yarn and well made. sweater has more structure to it than i had anticipated  which makes it look more tailered while being soft and comfortable. hits my lower hip and i'm 5'6"". receive compliments every time i wear it.",Fine gauge
1,I love this pretty sweater. i am petite and thin and ordered the regular xs. the length was perfect- just below the hips. the sleeves are a bit long but you can pull them up a bit. this is a perfect winter dressy sweater to wear with black jeans or leather pants. the knit is very delicate and light but warm and the layered chiffon bottom makes it special.,Fine gauge
1,Wore this poncho and received 5 compliments before the school day even began! love the pockets and hood. bought three at the sale price - one for me  a friend  and my niece - different ages and sizes but everyone of us love this poncho.,Fine gauge
1,I've been looking for a wrap cardigan for a while and this totally fit the bill. it fits well  is soft  and made of good materials. i love the versatility of using it with all my dresses. this is a great staple piece.,Fine gauge
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates

-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,Intimates
-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(,Intimates

-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates

0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates

1,I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person  but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong  and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic  then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however  i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines  and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern,Intimates

1,"I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!",Intimates
1,I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!,Intimates
1,I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it  my mom surprised me with a gift card  so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering  and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!,Intimates
1,This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said  great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.,Intimates
1,Hands down most comfortable bra ever!,Intimates
1,It is an expensive panty  but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!,Intimates
-1,This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.,Jackets
-1,"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird"".",Jackets
-1,Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.,Jackets
-1,I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts  but this way too high  and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall  slender person  but it's definitely not right for my short  curvy body. returning it today.,Jackets
-1,I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also  it's pretty short  and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.,Jackets
-1,A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.,Jackets
-1,I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.,Jackets
-1,The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.,Jackets
-1,"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl",Jackets
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.,Jackets
0,Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color  fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.,Jackets
0,The jacket is cute  it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.,Jackets
0,I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i,Jackets
0,I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.,Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets
0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets
0,"I really  really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately  i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6""  but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)",Jackets
0,The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high,Jackets
1,I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped. the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true,Jackets
1,The material is soft and the length is great. you can wear it with short or skinny jeans. the only drawback is the color because it is so light. it is pastel so if you like pastels it will be great for you.,Jackets
1,"I ordered this jacket thinking it would look good with so many of my current outfits. i'm usually between a small and medium in jackets  so taking the advise of the other reviewers  i went with a medium... while it fit in the arms just fine  the torso was tight! i couldnt even zip it up! i guess i should have gone with a large. after mulling it over  i decided to just return instead of exchanging. i felt the jacket had a much harder ""edge"" to it than my style is. i was very impressed with the qu",Jackets
1,I love the oversized look of this jacket--my building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional. (my boyfriend doesn't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished--if they were longer i think it would be too much just li,Jackets
1,This jacket is adorable.. it is very flattering and different. can easily be dressed up for work or dressed down as shown. note: it is unlined and very light weight. these are huge selling points for me as it makes the jacket seasonless. love it!!!,Jackets
1,I love linen i know it's a pain with the wrinkles but it's just a very nice crisp clean feel. this vest is wonderful it fits very nice  once you size down  and can work as a bathing suit cover up. i'm using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get that...i think they're all gone by now but if they aren't grab it while you can it's a must have for any woman's closet.,Jackets
1,"Yes  like the photo suggests  this piece has a lot of the features of a jacket. but  i bought it to also wear as a dress. let me explain...    fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist  dress/top size 10 (without buttons  etc.) or 12 (fitted at the bust and waist)  bottom size 6 (upside down triangle)  5'2""    i bought the small in this piece  because it is big enough to wear as a light jacket while also being fitted enough to wear as a dress. on the inside of the piece  there are strings that",Jackets
1,I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so  i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.,Jackets
1,Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer  and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture  maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses  skirts  and pants  a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.,Jackets
-1,"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",Jeans
-1,I ordered first the green  then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)  so short!!  is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??  anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.  i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!  note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.  i wear these pants in a tall  and live,Jeans
-1,I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(,Jeans
-1,I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist)  and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.,Jeans
-1,I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.,Jeans
-1,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,Jeans
-1,I really wanted to like these  but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i'm just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.,Jeans
-1,"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however  on me  they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste  and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus  back they went. for reference  i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6.",Jeans
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.,Jeans
0,These were very nice  but had to return. i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt. these were tight in those places and big in the waist ,Jeans
0,Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better,Jeans
0,The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.,Jeans
0,I love these jeans  but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.,Jeans

0,I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,Jeans

1,This is the weirdest  greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather  but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick  rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing.  also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim  but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape.  i got my regular size  and they fit beautifully  but they are not,Jeans
1,Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.    i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black  you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.,Jeans
1,They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.,Jeans
1,They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.,Jeans

1,The color  heft  style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.,Jeans
-1,Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.,Knits
-1,This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.,Knits
-1,I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.,Knits

-1,I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end  i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad  as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.,Knits

-1,"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm  no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b  weigh 110 pounds  5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!",Knits

0,I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock  and when it did  i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it's hit or miss with me as far as retailer's mediums and larges  depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution  so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package  but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom  and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing  but,Knits
0,Overall  a really nice top that is soft and comfortable. the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is well-constructed. didn't keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust  to the point of not being flattering. top is also a bit boxy  so i'd stay away if you are petite  with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis.,Knits
0,Pretty tee  but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful  but fit is blah.,Knits
0,For my body type  this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e.  boobs) this would work better.,Knits
0,Pretty top  i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.,Knits
0,Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,Knits
0,"I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut ",Knits
1,"This top is beautiful  the lace is sturdy and intricate and the top drapes perfectly  slimming. but  a word to the wise  the lace does not stretch at all even though the rest of the material does and that coupled with where it is on the bust and back means very limited movement unless you are a size 0 with an narrow back/chest and shoulders. i can't imagine anyone with a cup size larger than a b wearing this. i am 5'5""  145 lbs and a 34b and always a small or medium and a size 6 for reference. i",Knits

1,I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model. it's true to size. it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear. definitely needs a tank/cami underneath. i love the vintage look. it's worn well & washed well too. i'd love to see more versions in this same style. i'll get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall.,Knits
1,The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down. its definitely an instant favorite. and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue,Knits
1,This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well  too  and during cooler seasons  i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.    the fit of this top is not true to size  for it runs large  but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings  i noticed  add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.    as a whole  this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material,Knits

-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
1,I bought the white tank and the small fits me but it's very low cut for me. the white is sheer as well. i usually wear an xs or a small and i would be curious to see what the xs would fit like in the sense of how low cut it is.,Layering
1,I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,Layering
1,Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!,Layering
1,"At 5'4"" and 140 lbs  this tank is a nice thin under layer. a little low cut for trying to cover cleavage.",Layering
1,The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.,Layering
1,There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...,Layering
1,Awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.,Layering
1,I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots  but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one!,Layering

-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear

-1,So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~,Legwear
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.,Legwear
-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!,Legwear

0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still,Legwear

-1,I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.,Lounge
-1,I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.,Lounge
0,I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c,Lounge

1,1st  this jacket fits true to size. 2nd  the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing)  as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material  so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.    i purchased this jacket with 40% off sale price. i'm not sure it's worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility.,Outerwear

0,I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.,Pants
0,These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.,Pants
0,I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,Pants
0,I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason  this fabric isn't working for me. i think it's the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.,Pants
0,These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up  the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on  too  and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are  the better stripes look. they more curvy you are  the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.,Pants
0,I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.,Pants

1,I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically  wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray  i thought  they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash  the weight of the fabric? not sure  but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly  i will be sending them back.,Pants

-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts

-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts
-1,I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a,Shorts
0,I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately  the cut is different. the sides  covered here by the model's hands  flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted  being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt,Shorts
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o,Shorts

0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,Shorts
0,These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!,Shorts
0,"Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom",Shorts

1,These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string  which ended up working out  but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites  but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts  as th,Shorts

0,This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.,Skirts

0,The geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical  with nice geometry to it. the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture. i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag. unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out. first  it weighs a ton. a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater  hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater. second  it runs large. i am usually an xl or 16-18  but this sweater has lost of,Sweaters

0,I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw.,Sweaters
0,I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however  the color isn't quite yellow; it has a little green to it  kind of chartreuse.    i returned the item because it didn't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model. this would probably look better on someone taller than me.,Sweaters
0,I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day,Sweaters

1,I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans. if you are shorter i assume it would be longer. i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green. the bodice is fitted and doesn't show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving . love this sweater!,Sweaters
1,Thus sweater is perfect. the fit is exactly as i expected it from other reviews. it is super soft and not at all itchy. i have worn it over a tank top with jeans and boots as well as to work over a dress. the fact that i can wash it is an added bonus. i haven't dried it yet as i am worried it could shrink. i bought this with a discount but it is totally worth full price.,Sweaters
1,"This is such a fun pullover sweater! i'm not much for sweaters  so i thought this would be a neat alternative. im between a small and medium  so i went with the small due to the swing style. it fit wonderfully! i'm even happy with the length which completely covers my behind (i'm 5'6""). i choose the gray and it's a great neutral  but now i'm contemplating going back for the red as well! hopefully a promo will come along soon!",Sweaters

-1,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Swim
-1,While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!),Swim

-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,Swim
-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,Swim
-1,I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak,Swim

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
